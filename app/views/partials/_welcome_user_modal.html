            <h1>Welcome to MarketRex! </h1>

            <p>Your arrival is a very big deal to us. To get the most out of your MarketRex  experience, we encourge you to follow these 4 simple steps in chronological order</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Complete your <a href='profile/update' target="_new">profile</a></li>
                <li>2. Next, add some <a href='uploader/tenant_records/new' target="_new">data</a></li>
                <li>3. Next, you'll be ready to <a href='connections' target="_new">connect</a></li>
                <li>4. Once connected, you can begin your <a href='dashboard' target="_new">search</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>P.S. Don't forget, by forming connections, your data and your connection's data become instantly searchable by each other.</p>
            <p>P.S.S. But don't worry, until you approve an unlock request, your data is locked at all times (in search results) when viewed by any of your connections. </p>
